#I let the AI convice me to do this ðŸ™ƒ

My name is not Thomas, and I've been modding phones and other devices since the OG razr, and bricking them for just as long. I've never actually documented anything that I've done, and after figuring out
some new tricks with an older android phone I ~~decided~~ was coerced by an AI chatbot to create a blog. The idea here is to actually document my findings, as well as to create some SOPs,
both for myself (because i forget everything all the time), and for anyone else who may want or need some direction. I may also post some reviews, although it'll be mostly be older,
"obsolete" tech.
