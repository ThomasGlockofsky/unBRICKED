## This probably doesn't work anymore, fair warning

## Synopsis?

A few years ago a friend of mine somehow sent their iPhone (I don't remember which model or iOS) to the activation screen. We're not entirely sure how it happened. What we (and many others) do know is; on older iPhones, with older versions of iOS, you need to have a compatible sim card to get past the activation, or use Wi-Fi only. We also know that if you use Wi-Fi only and then add a non-compatible sim card, it will send you back to activation screen. I was able to get the phone "activated" with the non-compatible sim card.

## Instructions

Step 1) Go through whatever setup steps necessary and continue with Wi-Fi only. Stop right before the activation screen.  
Step 2) Insert the non-compatible sim card into sim tray, and PARTIALLY insert it into the phone. Keep the sim tool in the phone as well.  
Step 3) Continue to the activation screen. After it starts, insert the sim card, DO NOT REMOVE THE SIM TOOL.  
Step 4) This is the hard part. You essentially need to insert and remove the sim card repeatedly during the activation process. This will likely take many attempts. You'll know when you're down when the sim card is fully inserted and you're at the springboard (home screen). You should signal bars, and your network's name should be displayed as normal.  

That's it! I've always referred to it as the iPhone wobble or sim wobble. I haven't seen any other documentation on this, although I'm plenty of people have done and just never reported it. Again, i don't remember the model or iOS version, but it was an older phone, maybe a 7? It had a home button but I don't remember if it was a real button or the touch ID "button"

I have no idea if this works for any other activation lock out on the iPhone, as I've never been in a situation where I could test it.
